## hello again,
This is Rickle Pick (it used to be Bjoerk), hes my analytics tracking discord bot, he logs when people join and leave discord channels.
Along with these files, theres also a .env file containing the secret api keys used for interfacing with the discord api, it is however, part of the gitignore and as such will not be uploaded

#### UPDATE: Rickle Pick
This is the update for the rickle pick rework.  In addtion to changing the bots name, a scoreboard function has been introduced, accessible through "#tscore" along with a massive folder structure rework.  All of the folders have been changed to use user descriminators, or the four numbers after a users name.  This allows users to change their name, without losing their tracked time.
Lastly, the bot has also been modified to send its updates to two channels on two seperate servers, this is really jank at the moment and I am hopeful a better fix will be right around the corner.

#### UPDATE: Jun 23, 2021
The purpose of this bot was to use the analytics in order to predict when people are most likley to join and leave channels on discord, after having this bot for a number of months, I think enough data has been collected to start this process.  
However, after much thinking, I think I may have not been collecting all of the data I need, and as such along with the RICKLE PICK rewrite, I will be soon reworking the entire folder structure once again, this time to use discriminators as well as id's, and collecting more data such as the channel and server they joined to.
I have a lot of other things going on at the moment, so this may have to wait, at least until I get the prediction software working correctly.
