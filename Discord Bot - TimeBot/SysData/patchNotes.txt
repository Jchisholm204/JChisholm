Hi,
Just letting you know that TimeBot has gotten some new updates..

First,
TimeBot has gotten a reworked Help command, type #help to get a list of all of the commands or #help [command] to get help with a specific command.

Second,
TimeBot's update channel messaging has now been completely reworked.. TimeBot now only messages VC join/leave updates to channels called "timebot".  Timebot also only messages updates from a server to that server, No more getting updates from other servers.

Third,
As of this update, stats.csv has been officially depreciated in favor of UsrLogs.  UsrLogs contains more information than stats.csv as well as a fix for the line spacing

Fourth,
You now have 5 mins to leave and rejoin a channel after the bot comes back online to save your time

Lastly, The smaller updates,
@ everyone pings for when someone hits ten days have been removed, in fact, all @ everone pings have been removed
The bot still tracks when you hit ten dats, it just no longer notifies you
Also, the 10 command has been removed from help, but it is not gone, you can still use #10 to see when you hit ten days
I've added a new command!! Use the rm command to generate a random rick and morty quote

For ADMINS;
The authorize command has been restored to its full potential, use authorize to add a new ADMIN to give them access to bot backups
